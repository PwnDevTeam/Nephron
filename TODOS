
TODOS for Nephron.

*	Since i do have MobileDevice for Visual Basic
	One thing that would be awesome is if we could
	implement function to upload payloads and files
	If that's done there's no need for having iRecovery
	with Nephron.

*   Changing img3 containers to maybe Nephron's icon?
    Or even adding iH8sn0w's logo, fallensn0w's and 
	GreySyntax's logo together? That would be cool..
	
*   Find a better way to verify selected .ipsws.
    Currently it will just search InStr for tags like
	iPod, iPhone 3G, 3GS, 2G, 2, 3 and so on.
	Check the code for more.

*   Shrink everything together? Like adding iboot.patch
    Inside the Nephron.EXE so it will extract to temporary
	And delete it after it's done? Feels kind of useless to
	have folders for each iPod & iPhone.
